<h1>Welcome to Rock, Paper Scissors</h1>
<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, scissors, stone or other variants) is a game played between two people, in which each player chooses one of three shapes. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". A zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: one of the two players wins, and the other player loses.

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes" — or sometimes "blunts" — scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</p>
